This is my package repo for [s6-dns](http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6-dns/), a set of network librarys and tools by [Laurent Bercot](http://skarnet.org/).

The `upstream/` directory is taken directly from upstream. The rest of the repository is my packaging scripts for compiling a distributable build.
